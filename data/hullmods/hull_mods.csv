Internal markings (and the occasional bloodstain) paint a clear picture: This was once, and maybe still is, a %s of the %s, with all expense being made to turn it into a proper battlewagon of war. 

The internal shield generator has somehow been replaced by a full-size X03, increasing shield efficiency by %s, reducing shield EMP arc chance by %s, and increasing shield arc by %s.
A second atlas's flux vent-line has been daisy-chained, increasing flux dissipation by %s.
The retrofitted ATC has been optimized using some sort of gravitic targetting computer, increasing non-missile weapon range by %s.
Walls have been torn down in order to fit more missiles, increasing missile weapon ammo capacity by %s.
The engines have been overpowered via auxillary AM injectors, significantly increasing acceleration and deceleration speed.

All these modifications have been made with absolutely zero respect to the structure of the ship. It should be fine under normal operation, but hull integrity is reduced by %s and armor rating reduced by %s.",,,graphics/hullmods/damper_field.png
