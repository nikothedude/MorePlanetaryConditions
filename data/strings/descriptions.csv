niko_MPC_defenseSatelliteCore,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

When exploratorium drones discover a planet, they often perform rudimentary terraforming to better increase it's chances of becoming a viable planet for the ever-growing domain. One such terraform is to prevent any space debris from falling down to earth, and these satellites are one such way of doing it. Armed to the teeth with anti-asteroid, anti-scrap, and, some may argue, anti-ship weaponry, these quite intimidating orbital bastions dominate the orbit of whatever planet they orbit, preventing any unidentified and unauthorized matter from erronously entering their sphere of influence. 

Between those that were aware of the existance of these satellite prior to the collapse, there was often a hushed whisper and quiet idea that these satellites were built for more than just point-defense duty, rationalizing this obvious nonsense - at least, that's what domain ComSec portrayed it as - with the unusual amount of heavy weaponry and layered armor for something of it's nature.

MPC_omega_derelict_mothership,SHIP,"One of the legendary survey motherships, the quiet automated workhorse of the Domain exploration and colonization effort. This is in essence a von Neumann probe, as the survey motherships contain autoforge capacity to manufacture a suite of smaller survey ships and the supplies required to perform its ongoing mission. This specimen is burned and battered by its centuries of service to the Domain, a drifting forgotten hulk.

A fearsome intelligance has taken control over this instrument of science. Its weapon mounts have been upgraded, a large shield generator has been installed (of unknown make), and its hull has been reinforced by neutronium armor. Truely, a fearsome opponent.",,,

MPC_atlas2_kanta,SHIP,"Previously owned by a fierce pirate warlord, this once sub-par ""capital"" ship has been extensively modified to transform it into a terrifying vehicle of war, capable of glassing a small colony through firepower alone.

The Atlas-class superfreighter is a prime target of pirate attacks. A few are later found at the broken heart of a sharp spray of impact debris in some lonely orbit. Others earn a pirate's second appraising glance and are hauled off to secret shipyards. Cargo holds are ripped apart, replaced with trusses to hold weapons mounts and souped-up ammo feed lines.

This Atlas, reborn in vacuum and fire, now delivers a cargo of death from the hand of a pirate warlord.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The ramjet-class tug is a rare sight in the sector, due to the fact that their blueprint was only ever distributed to frontier reinforcement centers. Featuring an overclocked drive stabilizer, these tugs are known for being rather expensive to run - but well worth the cost.",,,
MPC_spearHead,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A very rare sight in the sector, owing to it's very specific role. Mbaye-Gogol was challenged with creating a cruiser-sized ship capable of bolstering frontier patrols while helping them catch up to escortees, and they delivered, with a massively oversized drive core so powerful it can be weaponized to disable the drive field of nearby ships - an unintended effect, but quite valuable, the engineers thought.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_pickhead,SHIP,"Fragile, lacking significant firepower, and with an abysmal comms module, the pickhead is only useful for budget close-up intercepting.

The outguard defense satellite doesn't actually destroy most orbitting asteroids by itself. The pickhead interceptor is actually a mining vessel, tasked with finding mineral-rich asteroids and carefully cutting them into harvestable chunks, and turning the mundane ones into space dust.",,,
MPC_minecart,SHIP,"Slow, bulky, and with an abysmal comms module, the minecart is still frighteningly effective in close range at both point-defense and bodyblocking for it's parent vessel.

Used in tandem with the pickhead-class interceptor, the minecart is used to haul materials back to it's parent satellite for processing. The LPC features an automatic combat augment - once combat is confirmed, any new craft created will have collapsed cargo holds - significantly hampering shuttling ability and speed, but vastly improving hull integrity.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_toyol,SHIP,"A rather recent design, even for phase standards, the Toyol-class battlecruiser comes equipped with an armament frightening enough to send even a Paragon running, as well as an extremely powerful coil-array capable of sending the vessel deep into unexplored p-space for brief periods.

Having only exited the prototype stage a few cycles before the collapse, the Toyol was created in small numbers and sold to only the most wealthy of clientele. The fact one exists in the Persean sector is a wonder, to say the least.

After p-space was discovered, scientists scrambled to find a way to harness the new dimension. Soon, phase coils were created, allowing for baryonic matter to - if briefly - travel into the surface of phase space. Unfortunately, the rudimentary technology involved in such coils relegated vessels to only the ""shallow"" waters, while the Toyol's XMX-35 coils are capable of a much deeper dive into uncharted territory. Lacking any significant turbulance, deep p-space allows the vessel to exist in a state of temporal flux nearly twenty times as slow as realtime. 

The few that have ever staffed a Toyol-class ship often refer to the experience as ""traumatic"" - not due to things like bulkhead-ruptures or gravitic shifts, but instead an uncommonly cited ""whispering behind the walls"", unfound in usual p-space.",,,
MPC_omegurat,SHIP,UNKNOWN ENTRY,Unidentified Vessel,Target profile resembles a phase-enabled hull on a theoretically impossible scale; likely highly unstable. Sensors indicate capital-equivalent weapon loadout in addition to anomalous readings suggesting one or more unknown technology systems. Tactical analysis adjunct cannot determine role of unknown technology. Extreme caution advised.,
MPC_spatialBreach,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Tears through space-time to place the ship in an unfamiliar area of p-space. Effectively a low-upkeep phase cloak, albiet with limited uptime, an extended downtime, and an explosive visual effect. Spawns motes as long as the system is active; has a small chance to spawn blue motes that attack the ship.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_lockbow,SHIP,"Converted from some unpopular cargo transport design not found in the persean sector, the 'Lockbow' - and other ships like it - carry the unique designation of ""missile carrier"", a highly prized ship classification that could make any Domain commander salivate. Capable of delivering various high-yield payloads across entire star systems, the Lockbow is - if technically subpar - surely a prize worth fighting for.

Missile carriers formed a important part of the Domain's core military doctrine, able to project force over vast swaths of space without the need for an entire battlegroup to patrol the space. 
Missile carriers are foreign to the Persean sector, and that's not by accident. The only place missile carriers were used liberally were the Domain core worlds, and on the rare long range patrol by a carrier group. A missile carrier falling in the wrong hands was considered an emergency - while a battlegroup can defeat any rebellion in a standup fight, they typically sport weak defense against intra-stellar basllistic missiles capable of delivering enough energy to crack a planet.

This may be why the Lockbow is such a rare, coveted, and less-documented ship designation. It is less of a strict label, and more of a descriptor: Any lockbow is a civilian, mercenary, or otherwise sub-par ship converted around a often-misplaced missile complex. In this ones case, the missile complex used is the classic XLY-293 - quite deprecated, but still very deadly. The low-tech nature of the cargo-freighter hull creates a humorous divide, however; given its size, nearly half the ship is the original, rust-bucket frieghter, and the other half is an ultratech missile forge. It certainly doesn't make the ship easier to maintain.",,,
MPC_cruiseLauncher,WEAPON,"While typically suited for firing ISBMs across vast swaths of space, the XLY-293 missile complex also includes limited close-combat capabilities, such as a 100 gigaton nuclear warhead with a maximum speed of five thousand kilometers per hour and advanced optics. One must simply hit the switch.

MPC_superheavyDamper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"An ancient design of the damper field that was discontinued due to the fact that it was extremely inefficient and had to shut down engines to prevent interference. 

Very briefly activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage by 90% at the cost of disabling engines, generating a significant amount of flux, and halving the fire rate of all weapons.",Defensive,"Very briefly activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage by 90% at the cost of disabling engines, generating a significant amount of flux, and halving the fire rate of all weapons.",

MPC_magnetic_field_hyper,TERRAIN,"An extremely strong magnetic field which traps high energy charged particles. It's extremely difficult to get any sensor readings on a fleet lurking within, and often impossible, due to the frequency of ion storms.",,,
MPC_mesonField,TERRAIN,"A thick field of meson particles. Due to their signature enhancing nature, it's very easy to get a clear sensor reading on a fleet passing through. The effect is inverted, however, once meson concentration surpasses the Burivil threshold, and instead fleets lurking within find their sensors massively amplified and their own signature hidden.",,,
MPC_magnetarField,TERRAIN,"Naturally produced by magnetars, these magnetic fields are unfathomobly strong, capable of shredding atoms into quark cylinders. Thankfully, if one keeps their distance, they can usually avoid the worst - but magnetars typically make that difficult.",,,

,,,,,
MPC_devilRocketPod,WEAPON,"The devil-class torpedo combines the destructive power of the famous reaper with a long-distance ion thruster, creating a terrifyingly effective cruise missile capable of striking targets from across the battlefield with 50 MJ of explosive force. A combat-rated autoloader system ensures usefulness in protracted engagements.

The devil-class torpedo consists of two parts: An ion thruster block, and the payload. The payload is rather uninteresting - merely a downsized reaper-class torpedo fitted on a thin frame. The ion block, though, is a rather fascinating piece of technology. Instead of chemical propellant, it ionizes miniscule amounts of gas to travel at impressive speeds, removing the need for a bulky fuel tank. Unfortunately, it was considered impractical for its intended use as a starship thruster due to the prohibitive costs associated with installing one - to say nothing of the flux costs, which paradoxically makes their performance worse than chemical thrusters due to the zero-flux boost.

Early testing showed promise in long-ranged ordnance, but the “Decisive Battle” naval doctrine the domain fielded prevented its adoption outside of specialized cases. A specialized case appeared with the advent of the Outguard-class defense satellite, and the lack of properly long-ranged missiles soon became evident. Thus, the devil was born, with the express purpose of intercepting fast-moving asteroids at long-range before they impact the satellite’s protectorate.
",,,
MPC_pinprickPod,WEAPON,"With a fuel-to-weight ratio of 90%, the pinprick can travel for hundreds of kilometers without even flaming out. Its utility is limited by the utter lack of payload, made even worse by its flathead design. A combat-rated autoloader system ensures usefulness in protracted engagements.

Created for the same reason as the devil-class torpedo, the pinprick is a long-ranged support missile. Its strange characteristics are explained by its intended role - to strike asteroids into pieces small enough for any atmosphere to burn them up.

Unlike its cousin, the pinprick uses conventional propulsion instead of an ion thruster, enabling it to be mounted far more easily, and with no flux cost.

",,,
MPC_scatterpin,WEAPON,"A smaller derivative of the pinprick, the scatterpin fires a spread of flathead missiles capable of severely damaging exposed hull.",,,
MPC_heavyFlak,WEAPON,"A flak cannon upgraded with superheavy rounds, the heavy flak cannon sits in the uncomfortable role of PD specialist as a large ballistic. Thankfully, however, it's area denial capabilities make it a worthy pick.",,,
MPC_tachyonPike,WEAPON,"Comprised of technology alien even to the Domain at the time of it's (relatively recent) invention, the tachyon pike takes the destructive power of the tachyon lance to the extreme, capable of fielding trillions of tachyons in only a matter of seconds, at extreme cost to both firer and firee.

While the tachyon lance is considered arcane in it's own right, the tachyon pike is another beast alltogether, clearly evidenced by it's exotic material makeup. While the ""traditional"" lance channels tachyons through hyperspace, the pike neither has it's own supply of tachyons nor channels it's tachyons through anything. Instead, a micro-brane singularity at the core of the device generates a gargantuan storm of tachyons that are concentrated into a dense stream and fired out the barrel, stabilized only through some sort of psuedo-magnetic field, theorized to perpetuate in p-space. All other components are a complete mystery.

That mystery is quite the curiosity to many a weapon specialist in the sector, given how this weapon surfaced only a thousand cycles ago, ahead of the Domain claiming a ""breakthrough"" in weapons science. While the Domain never laid claim to this weapon, many speculate if the Domain did in fact engineer it - or, at least, found it.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_coronaResistStation,CUSTOM,"A potentially abandoned research station, built either to study some interesting local phenomenon or to study that which is best kept far, far away from inhabited worlds. Its oddity is immediately noticable - the ionized beam of the nearby pulsar curves around the station as if repelled by an invisible force, and sensor sweeps show clear signs of activity both inside and outside the station.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_baryonEmitterStandard,CUSTOM,"Portable baryon emitters such as this one are useful for supporting attacking fleets during a military action such as a raid. One quickly realizes why they were typically built on planets - the potential output, without a massive power district, is middling at best, and can only partially protect a fleet from the dangers of space. 

These pre-collapse emitters are considered both a rarity and a sad reminder of what we lost, as no current faction has found the DRM needed to produce one - and the cost of such construction would be prohibitive.
",,,
MPC_baryonEmitterPostcollapse,CUSTOM,"Portable baryon emitters such as this one are useful for supporting attacking fleets during a military action such as a raid. One quickly realizes why they were typically built on planets - the potential output, without a massive power district, is middling at best, and can only partially protect a fleet from the dangers of space. 

Constructed using a recovered fac-chip and smartly substituted resources, this emitter is not only incredibly cheaper than the propietary ErugNostic units, but significantly more effective - though still inferior in comparison to a planet-based emitter. This piece of machinery is proof that, despite everything, we can recover what we've lost.

,,,,,
MPC_star_blackDwarf,PLANET,"Once considered theoretical, a black dwarf is the final stage of life for any main sequence star. After exhausting all fusable material, white dwarves cease to output any significant light or energy, leaving behind a scorching-hot mass of degenerate matter, slowly cooling into an inert ball of stable metal.

Domain scientists reacted to the discovery of black dwarves in the sector with a mixture of intrigue and fright - on one hand, it allows for a new perspective on astrophysics and cosmo-chronology. On the other hand, it implies our universe my be aging faster than we anticipated.
",,,
MPC_star_magnetar,PLANET,"A variant of a neutron star, magnetars are the most magnetically powerful entities in the known universe, with a field strong enough to rip even non-ferric material apart on a molecular level. Conventional physics break down on its surface, as atoms are deformed into quark cylinders, possibly even forming strange matter.

While the Domain was happy to visit pulsars and even singularities with their survey drones, every single known instance of a magnetar was given a black mark in the exploratorium record, owing to their unique ability to destroy drive fields. Whether it's a pulse or stream magnetar, the sheer energy contained in their output is enough to leave a fleet helpless for days or even weeks - that is, if they don't fall victim to the evercalling magnetic pull of the star. Every spacer has the same advice - stay away, for death awaits you.",,,
MPC_gasGiantIntrastellarCapture,PLANET,"Primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. The temperature and pressure at the core are extreme, but not enough to sustain the deuterium fusion that would turn the planet into a brown dwarf star.

This gas giant resides past the ""frost line"" of the nearby star, where normal gas giants rarely, if ever, form. While carefree minds quickly jump to conspiracy theory, your scientists are pretty sure this is just an interstellar capture.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_magnetarBeacon,CUSTOM,"A fully autonomous warning beacon. Contains a solid-state power system which enables theoretical operation and station-keeping half-life with an upwards range in the hundreds of thousands of cycles. This one is not doing so well - it's pulses are faint, and inconsistantly timed. Something is clearly wrong with it.

The astute starship captain will heed well its warning... if it still has one to give.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_magnetarShield,CUSTOM,"Little more than a slab of metal with stabilizing boosters attached, it appears to have been placed here to provide mobile cover for fleets operating in this system. Hiding behind it should shield you from the magnetar's pulses.

MPC_omegaDerelict_probe,CUSTOM,"An example of one of the countless thousands of robot probe ships sent out into the galaxy by the Domain to find new resources to exploit, planets to colonize, and explore the unknown. Some variants are produced by automated motherships. This specimen appears to be inactive; pitted by small impacts, its hull displays iridescence from fearsome radiation scarring. This probe's manufacture could well date to a thousand cycles ago.

This one has had extensive modifications done to it, including shielding against the nearby magnetar.",,,
MPC_omegaDerelict_survey_ship,CUSTOM,"An automated survey ship from a long-past wave of Domain exploration. Thousands of ships like this were sent in waves, some independent, others attached to (or manufactured by) similarly automated motherships following the first wave of robot probes. This apparently unresponsive hulk has been ravaged by centuries of exposure to charged particles and high velocity impacts from interstellar dust.

MPC_station_researchMagnetarOne,CUSTOM,"A strange research station of domain make, your ship's computer automatically designates it as ""2HHBID"", sending your bridge crew into a confused frenzy, searching for whatever database it drew from.

Unlike the other structures of the system, it is neither constructed to exploratorium standards nor (as far as your sensors can tell) modified to the eggshell standard of everything else. Worryingly, your sensors still pick up power fluctuations within the core, meaning it may still be active.

MPC_guardStationDescViolence,CUSTOM,"An old star fortress, marked by both battle and time. It's surface is pockmarked by impact craters, though seemingly filled in via a repair effort, and it's paint is faded by relentless exposure to the nearby black hole. Curiously, it most closely matches the ARMD-5 pattern star fortress - one swapped out for the more modern ARMD-6 just before the collapse. Whatever this is, it's old. Very old.

It seems partially submerged in the blood-red energy field, and could be a possible vector for approach.

MPC_guardStationDescIntelligence,CUSTOM,"An atypical research station, following atypical design principles. These types of stations were frequently seen in specialized research operations, as their unique shape and design allowed them to be hyper-specialized towards a single purpose.

MPC_singularityStagingStation,CUSTOM,"Often nicknamed ""pontoons"", staging stations are typically used during long-term construction work prior to the creation of the to-be-built structure itself. Crafted using pre-fab blocks, they can do little more than house workers, pump air, and moor ships. Once the job is done, they are usually dismantled for what little salvage they can provide.

A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,

MPC_planetPhaseAlloy,PLANET,"A geologically unstable planet without a permanently formed crust. Glowing fissures and active volcanoes litter the surface, the magma they spew forth combining to form flows that travel hundreds of kilometers across the charred surface.

Your sensors officer reports unusual readings - reminiscent of a phase coil - from the planet's core. The accretion disc makes further investigation difficult - you will have to enter orbit to perform any further analysis.

MPC_ultimaSingularity,PLANET,"The result of the apocalyptic collapse of a massive star. No object can escape from the black hole, nor light itself. The black hole does however emit detectable Hawking radiation due to poorly-understood quantum effects. No information can be detected beyond the event horizon with any device known to exist in the Sector. The intense gravity of the black hole rips and tears nearby objects into an accretion disc which inevitably spirals into the gravitational abyss. Extremely dangerous. This black hole is completely shrouded in an awe-inspiring accretion disc, derived from the nearby planet. 

Your sensors report exotic phase readings eminating from the core of the singularity. It is unlike anything you, or any scientist in the sector, for that matter, has ever seen before. To make matters worse, this SHOULD be an impossibility - nothing can escape the event horizon of a black hole. And yet, here you are, listening to whining phase oscillation.

Emblazed on its side is a kilometer-long emblem, an orange-white chevron - though, the colors are hard to make out, granted the natural decay of unmaintained paint in vaccum.

Thankfully, it seems to be inactive. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
