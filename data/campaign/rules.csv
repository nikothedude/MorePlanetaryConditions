A quick sensor sweep shows startlingly high p-space activity, the endpoints of which show high baryon concentration. It is these points that correspond with the deflection of the pulsar, explaining the anomalous protection. A deeper scan shows something much more worrying: The station is powered, active, and containing organic life, with one particular set of hangars holding a flotilla of combat-ready ships (with the rest seemingly occupied by derelict auto-forges ready to churn out ship after ship after ship). Clearly, someone has occupied this station, and may not be exactly welcoming. If they have detected you or not is unknown, though ELINT systems are on alert.

You dismiss your crew to a well-earned day off, and pull up the output onto your primary monitor. What you see justifies the mandated overtime. Your officers have pinned down a small section of sensor readings of only a few fleets, about five cycles ago, making odd movements and actions. Curiously, these fleets are all piloted by Tri-Tach executives, who really have no reason to be hiding out in a nebula with their transponder off - or hacking the sensor array.
