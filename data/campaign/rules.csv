A quick sensor sweep shows startlingly high p-space activity, the endpoints of which show high baryon concentration. It is these points that correspond with the deflection of the pulsar, explaining the anomalous protection. A deeper scan shows something much more worrying: The station is powered, active, and containing organic life, with one particular set of hangars holding a flotilla of combat-ready ships (with the rest seemingly occupied by derelict auto-forges ready to churn out ship after ship after ship). Clearly, someone has occupied this station, and may not be exactly welcoming. If they have detected you or not is unknown, though ELINT systems are on alert.
