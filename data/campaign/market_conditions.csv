Domain-Era Anti-Asteroid Satellites,niko_MPC_antiAsteroidSatellites_derelict,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.defenseSatellite.niko_MPC_derelictAntiAsteroidSatellites,"$market has its orbit dominated by an array of hundreds of thousands of domain-era exploratorium anti-asteroid satellites, presumably placed by survey drones in an attempt to increase terraforming viability. Each one is outfitted with enough weaponry to annihilate a small asteroid field, and enough armor to sustain the impact of their scattered debris. Coincidentally, these characteristics also make them excellent at destroying pre-collapse scavengers and rebels-those whom fleets composed of converted civilian ships with weak shields, unreliable targeting computers, and plentiful missiles. Their effectiveness in the current day is also quite impressive, given how few of these planets are ever explored.",graphics/icons/markets/niko_MPC_antiAsteroidSatellites.png,10
Overgrown Nanoforge,niko_MPC_overgrownNanoforgeCondition,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.overgrownNanoforge.overgrownNanoforgeCondition,"An old derelict (yet still unnervingly active) nanoforge constantly churns. It's growth safeties disabled, it will produce a significant amount of resources while continuously ""spreading"", with each growth providing some sort of positive and negative at the cost of a structure slot.",graphics/icons/markets/niko_MPC_overgrownNanoforge.png,10
Ultramagnetic Field,niko_MPC_ultraMagneticField,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.terrain.magfield.niko_MPC_hyperMagneticField,"$market is a scientific oddity. The convections of molten metal in the core are energetic past what should be possible, resulting in an extremely powerful magnetic field, the magnetic strength of which nearly reaches a full tesla during the storms that constantly wrack the surface.

On the surface, any loose ferromagnetic object is swiftly pulled to the ground, and any unshielded electronic quickly destroyed, rendering inhabitation a tiring prospect. However, the immense magnetic force inhibits wireless communication between vulnerable communication systems, and scrambles any sensors scanning the surface - meaning hidden weapons installations remain hidden.",graphics/icons/terrain/magnetic_storm.png,10
Hyperspace Bipartisan,niko_MPC_hyperspaceBipartisan,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.terrain.hyperspace.niko_MPC_hyperspaceLinked,"$market is host to a rift between dimensions, a direct link to hyperspace.

Theorized to be caused by the p-resonance of a particular element deep within the planet's core (coupled with its gravitational field), the space around $market is sufficiently unstable enough to be used as a hyperspace jump point. Unfortunately, this jump point is always stuck open, causing a slow but steady outpour of hyperspace into realspace. While incredibly inconvenient for approach and takeoff, the constant sensor readings from hyperspace allow for very accurate tracking of slipstreams, even from a distance. Additionally, the volatile hyperclouds surrounding $market are a useful defensive option, as well as a great source of volatiles.

Due to the accumulation factor, as well as the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the clouds may not always envelop the planet. Moving it would certainly isolate it from their benefits and hazards as well.",graphics/icons/terrain/hyperspace_storm.png,10

Pre-Collapse STC Districts,niko_MPC_ftcDistricts,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.niko_MPC_FTCDistricts,"$market was once a regional hub of space traffic, evidenced by the smattering of Space Traffic Control districts atop the surface. These collections of beuracracy harbor numerous p-switched sensor arrays, gravitic interstellar mapping systems, and tachyon-based communication systems - all of which are quite hard to come by in the modern sector. Sadly, the instruments are too delicate to properly move off world, but they may be used where they sit.

Despite the rather thin traffic of the post-collapse sector, these districts can still be used to coordinate better flight paths across the system.",graphics/icons/markets/niko_MPC_STC.png,10
Pre-Collapse Spy Arrays,niko_MPC_spyArrays,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.niko_MPC_spyArrays,"$market's atmosphere gently glimmers with the shine of countless small stealth-coated satellites (marked innocently with a ""Ko Combine"" sticker) observing their surroundings, corroborating their findings with sensor panels tucked away in clandestine places, and submitting heaps of raw data to a long-dead supercomputer array, nestled neatly within the planet's crust.

These sensor networks were often used in the fringe of domain space to keep an ""eye"" on unruly worlds, while supporting covert operations in the area. The domain never admitted their existance, and when pressed, would often talk of ""surveying equipment"" - nobody could disprove them, as nobody could find more than one satellite, panel, or computer at a time. 

The output of the array is completely encrypted in Domain 928-ASHHASH standard, which is considered both extremely unusual and extremely hard to crack, meaning the only decryptable datastreams (thanks to a Domain datavault breach a few cycles after the collapse) are the ones used for observation of dissidents, observation of spaceborn objects, and covert action support. Despite this, an array of this sort would surely be fairly valuable to anyone willing to use it.",graphics/icons/markets/niko_MPC_spyArray.png,10

Toteliac Habitat,niko_MPC_carnivorousFauna,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.niko_MPC_carnivorousFauna,"$market is habitat to a wild Toteliac population - highly invasive and aggressive felines, descending from the ancient african lion of legend. Titanium claws, diamond teeth, and obsidian-strength hide, coupled with an incredible sense of smell, digging instinct, and uncanny environmental adaption combine into the alpha predator of alpha predators, capable leaping 60 feet in the air to grab a shuttle, tear open its chassis, and devour the occupants, all to satisfy their massive half-carnivorous appetite.

Toteliacs have a complex history. As far as the record goes, it's said Toteliacs were originally invented as an ""organic"" solution to clearing unwanted fauna/flora out of terraforming candidates. Unfortunately, while ecologically ""friendly"", they were outclassed by more traditional methods, and so the Toteliacs were sold off as to not waste credits. They served a variety of roles, from show animals, to guard beasts, to even exotic pets (much to the chargin of hospitals everywhere). Their most common role, however, was to be as livestock in highly controlled environments, as it was said that Toteliacs had the taste of perfectly seasoned steak, and their pelts made the best coats.

Unfortunately, the collapse brought an end to all this, and in the chaos, Toteliacs seem to have escaped the hundreds of safety nets the Domain had set in place to prevent ecological runaway from these creatures. They are now commonly considered to be highly dangerous pests - though their flesh and pelts are still highly desired.",graphics/icons/markets/MPC_carnivorous_fauna.png,

Frontier Reinforcement Center,niko_MPC_derelictEscort,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.derelictEscort.niko_MPC_derelictEscort,"$market is home to a sub-gamma ""management"" core, as well as sporadic auto-drone bays across the equator, filled to the brim with autofactories, ready to build and launch at a moments notice.

Setups like these - ""reinforcement centers"" as they were called - were deployed in particuarly piracy-rich sector frontiers to simultaniously reinforce trade fleets and act as a comms relay, which are often the first target of any pirate attack. While not capable of interstellar communications, the management core is able to route most intra-stellar comms through the planet it resides on - to the dismay of said planets IT workers, who constantly battle with the AI to achieve consistant intra-planetary communication. As a result, approaches to these planet often have large wait times, as the STC waits for an open channel. Disgruntled spacers have often tried to remove these cores from power - but fail, due to the Domains insistance on protecting them enough to survive a pirate invasion.",graphics/icons/markets/MPC_derelict_escort.png,

Magnetar Devastation,niko_MPC_magnetarCondition,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.magnetar.niko_MPC_magnetarCondition,"$market is nigh-uninhabitable as a result of it's proximity to the nearby magnetar. The magnetic influences on the mantle cause unstable gravity, atmospheric disturbances, and spectacular volcanic eruptions that extend hundreds of kilometers above the surface until hardening into rock and continuing the doomed journey towards the star. If that wasn't bad enough, the surface is frequently slammed by pulses of highly ionized particles, rendering any speculation of a colony moot by complete lack of technological function.",graphics/icons/markets/MPC_magnetar_field_condition_icon.png,60
