Fixes a crash with the warlords warship hullmod (WHY CANT YOU EXCEED 9 HIGHLIGHTS???)
Stellar shields now clarify that you can click on them to automatically shelter behind them
Clarifies how the pulse blocking works in the magnetar intel
Clarifies how the astronomical barrier projector works

Fixed a bug where the astronomical barrier projector would say you have too many baryon emitters and still let you build

3.7.0
SAVE COMPATIBLE

The funny core
    Increased range-matching boost from 250 to 300
    Gave it a special combat chatter personality

Renamed the magnetar quest stages so it tells you to find the artifact rather than the system

Kanta atlas mk2 now has 300% accel/decel speed

3.6.0:
SAVE COMPATIBLE

Rebranded to "what we left behind"

Run niko_MPC_genSpecialContent if updating

Fixed a rare crash with derelict escorts

Adds a terrifying secret
    Adds questline that points you to it - requires wormhole scanner and level 14

3.5.0:
PROBABLY SAVE COMPATIBLE? DEPENDS ON IF YOU HVAE A BARYON EMITTER ANYWHERE

Make sure to run niko_MPC_genSpecialContent if updating

Derelict escort
    Fleets may now enter abyssal hyperspace

Defense Satellites
    Accessability decrement: 30% -> 10%
        Was arbitrary all this time, I just think its too high

    Variants reworked to get rid of machine guns in favor of either more HE or frag
    Num bays reduced to 2

    Weapon arcs reworked - now have a very notable blindspot behind the core

    Frontal plates size changed to cruiser, connector module changed to frigate
    Removed frontal armor plating, because it was honest to god pointless
    Swarm variant removed pending refactor
    Plate overclocked targetting duration: 5s -> 7s

Hyperspace Bipartisan
    Hazard rating: +75% -> +50%
        Its super rare, it should be better

General
    Removed the duplication of transponder and go dark abilities
        Added code to remove the abilities for this version only
    Skulioda FP: 70 -> 100
    Projected solar shielding energy reduction: 10% -> 30%
    Projected solar shielding description updated

        MCTE users may rejoice

3.4.0:
SAVE COMPATIBLE

Overgrown Nanoforge
    Clarified that overgrown nanoforges give a very powerful item when culled
    Added a button to the core UI that toggles the built-in commodity weighting
        TLDR is that supply adjustments previously had a super high chance of picking a commodity the nanoforge already produces
        Now you can toggle it
    Can now generate with indevo's ship components

Ultra-Magnetic fields
    Fixed a bug where ultra-magnetic fields would have null names (and cause crashes)

Derelict Escort
    Colonized FP increased to 50
    Timeout increased to 60 days

    Changes the derelict escort target names to be generic, to not spoil what theyre following
        Close-range escorting still says the name since its pretty obvious most of the time

    Escort fleets now force the simulation of fleets they escort
        Otherwise, youll never see a trade fleet in the core worlds with an escort
        Can be disabled in lunalib if save bloat/performance is a problem

    Added a lunasetting to disallow escorts from spawning on patrols

    Added new ability AI to escort fleets
        Will now go dark if their target has gone dark
        Will keep transponder onto the state of their target's transponder

Mod interactions
    Conditions now properly interact with AOTD industries
    Special treatment in a few cases for the military garrison (overgrown nanoforges, toteliacs)

3.3.3:
SAVE COMPATIBLE

Fixed a bug where XIV legions would spawn with custom smods (fuck)
    If XIV legions are still spawning with this variant after updating, try running niko_MPC_genericCommand
    You can test this by running AddShip legion_xiv_Elite and investigating the ship the game adds to your fleet

Reduced spawnrate of FTC districts, spy arrays, meson fields and hypermagnetic fields

3.3.2:
SAVE COMPATABLE

New condition: Frontier reinforcement center
    Fairly rare
    Prioritizes un-inhabitable planets over inhabitable ones

    Spawns a small escort fleet for all friendly/trade fleets in system
        Scales with fleet size
        The fleets follow for 30-35 days with no distance limit
        The fleets have a huge burn bonus so they can always keep up with their target
        Will join their targets in combat

        Basically, Tiandong two

    Has a timeout period between fleets to prevent fleet spam
    Once fleets are done and returning, they ignore all fleets
        You cant get infinite felet strength this way, sorry

    Decreases accessability significantly
    Somewhat increases accessability of all friendly markets in-system
        Not just your own

    +25% hazard rating

Fixed a bug with satellite discovery
Made a satellite debug string more clear
Clarified that the error toggle is in lunasettings

Toteliac food production increased by 1

Skulioda's variant has been changed to wreak havoc on MCTE users
    I'm the author of MCTE, I get to do this
    Only applies if MCTE is enabled as well as the relevant effect
    Prepare yourself for thumpers, needlers, and talons
    Skolioda is now reckless to facilitate this
        Again, MCTE has to be enabled

Reduced the size of Skulioda's fleet as well as the num of defender fleets

The baryon field structure now has a little upkeep

Reduced the hyperspace topography value of ultra magfields and meson fields

3.3.1:
SAVE COMPATIBLE

Fixes being able to scan ANY jump point as a bipartisan jump point
Fixes UNGP storm rider not applying to bipartisan hyperstorms

3.3.0:
SAVE COMPATIBLE

New condition: Toteliac Habitat
    Carnivorous fauna
    Alpha predators, extremely invasive
    +50% hazard
    Military bases suppress the hazard rating and generate food/luxury goods, as long as supplies/fuel are in good supply

    Only generates on worlds that could feasibly harbor these creatures
    As such, they are rare, at 99% of worlds are uninhabitable wastelands
        Even on habitable worlds they are uncommon

STC districts
    Discover value reduced

Spy Arrays
    Discover value reduced

Added config for satellites blocking same-faction fleets
    Defaults to off

Ultra-Magnetic Field
    Now reduces refining upkeep by 80%
    Thematic

Hyperspace Bipartisan
    No longer spawns on habitable worlds
        How can you survive exposure to a goddamn hypercloud
    Added clarification to the condition tooltip showing what effects are disabled upon leaving the hypercloud
        Also hints that a planetary shield works

Added a secret in the deep expanse of space
    Tip: Bring your sunscreen, because they already have SPF 2000
    Made a save before this? Don't worry, just run niko_MPC_genSpecialContent

Fixed typos

3.2.0:
PROBABLY SAVE COMPATIBLE

New terrain: Meson field
    Magfield-like: Same texture, has storms, is a ring
    Colored piss yellow
    Has a wider orbit than magfields so they dont overlap

    Spawns randomly via procgen

    The normal meson field significantly increases the sensor profile of any fleets inside it
    Meson storms are small, long-lasting, and have a fun little effect:
    Instead of increasing sensor profile, they decrease it and massively increase sensor strength
        Risk reward system: You find one in a remnant system and try to get into the storm to sensor burst and see everything around you

All terrain can now be scanned for hyperspace topography
    Hyperspace bipartisan
        Scan the jump points, the clouds are weirdly inconsistant
    Ultramagnetic field
    Meson field

New command: niko_MPC_findTerrainWithId
FindPlanetsWithCondition changed to niko_MPC_findPlanetsWithCondition

Anti-Asteroid Satellites
    Added a ability to ground battles: Satellite Barrage
    Requires friendly satellites over the planet
    Single industry target
    For three turns, damages enemy units on the target industry and forces them to be reorganized for at least one turn
        This reduces their outputted damage and makes them unable to move out of the industry
        Basically, suppressive fire

    Long cooldown
    No global cooldown - can be used in conjunction with other abilities

Hyperspace Bipartisan
    Slipstream detection radius no longer scales on pop size, is now a flat 7 ly
    Planetary shields now make the market count as not being in the clouds

STC districts
    Spawn rate reduced
    Changed defense increase to mult for simplicity

Spy arrays
    Spawn rate reduced
    Changed defense increase to mult for simplicity
    Stealth bonus is now 0.5x - thats half the detected-at range baby

Ultramagnetic field
    Changed defense increase to mult for simplicity

Updated tips

LunaSettings separated into sections

Bug fixes
    Fixed a bug where indevo arty stations could be fought in an inappropiate setting by engaging defense satellites
        Fixed a crash caused by this
        Defense satellites now take lower rules priority than arty stations
    Adjust defense overgrown nanoforge effect should now generate

3.1.1:
SAVE COMPATABLE

Junk handlers no longer try to exceed the maximum amount of junk structures defined in industries (Caused a crash before)

3.1.0:
PROBABLY SAVE COMPATABLE?

Four new conditions
    Hyperspace Bipartisan
        A rift between realspace and hyperspace
        Creates a ring of deep hyperspace in the planet orbits path
            Does its best to predict all possible positions the planet could be at if the orbit is recursive
            If no orbit, just spawns a ring around the planet
        Spawns a jump point that tightly orbits around the planets radius

        Significantly increases slipstream detection radius, increasing with pop size
        Significantly increases defense rating
        +75% hazard, +50% access
        +3 volatiles production

        Very very rare

    Hypermagnetic field
        Spawns a massive magnetic field that storms a lot
            Good for hiding in hostile systems

        Significantly increases defense rating
        +50% hazard, -25% access
        Makes mining convert half its ore/rare ore output into metals/transplutonics

        Very rare

    Pre-Collapse STC Districts
        +3 slipstream detection radius
        +100 defense rating
        +1 max burn and +350 sensor range to all friendly/trade fleets in system

        Uncommon

    Pre-Collapse Spy Arrays
        +200 defense rating
        +1 stability

        0.7x sensor profile to all friendly/trade fleets in system

        Uncommon

Bug fixes
    Overgrown nanoforge icon is now properly sized

Satellites
    2 ways to bypass satellites as things like smuggling were just impossible in places like raesvelg

    Phase Ships
        Based on the percent of phase ships in your fleet, you have 5 modes
            Sub 30%-Cant bypass
            30%+: 3 SP
            50%+: 2 SP
            70%+: 1 SP
            95%+: 0 SP

    ECM
        Based on the ECM percent of the fleet
            Yes, the ECM skill works
            <10%: Cant bypass
            >10%: 3 SP
            >=25%: 2 SP
            >=40%: 1 SP

        Reduces rep with the market owner, massively increases smuggling suspicion, and sends fleets to investigate you
        Easier to get than phase percent so harsher

Settings
    Most settings converted to lunasettings
    Extra overgrown nanoforge options added

General
    Conditions made more common, across the board
    Put a .kra file in a compressed archive, massively reducing the mod's filesize

3.0.3:
Removes the niko_MPC_convertObjectsToEnum command, the game should now automatically fix the bug

3.0.2:
Fixes intel crashes, use niko_MPC_convertObjectsToEnum command if updating from previous versions
Makes overgrown nanoforges a bit rarer
Overgrown nanoforges have 1 less intel tab

3.0.1:
Update to Starsector 0.97a

3.0.0:
INCOMPATABLE WITH PREVIOUS SAVES
Update to Starsector 0.96a-RC10

New condition: Overgrown Nanoforge:
    A old abandoned industial nanoforge, endlessly expanding in a grey-goo scenario. 
Adds industry: Overgrown Nanoforge
    Has a inherent costless and demandless output of goods
    Will continuously generate structures that augment it's stats
        Ex. A structure that increases the industry's supply output by 3, but increases upkeep by 2000 credits.
        A structure that increases accessibility, but lowers fuel output by 1.
    These structures do not instantly deconstruct, and the process of creation cannot be instantly stopped
        It takes time and money to do so
    Prior to construction, the effects of the structures become progressively more known as it nears the end
        Encourages you to make early judgements on if you want to start destroying it before it's made, at less cost
    
    The main industry is only destroyable once all connected structures are destroyed
        Once destroyed, you receive a unique nanoforge item that massively increases commodity output of any structure it's inserted into,
        but has various negative effects
        If installed in heavy industry, increases faction-wide fleet size by 400% but reduces ship quality by 400% as well
    The growths cease to grow and benefits are unapplied if the visible structure amount exceeds the vanilla cap
        Sorry grand sector
    At max structures (NOT ABOVE!), growths will begin to destroy and overtake existing structures
        A really needy bonsai tree
        Encourages you to stay on top of it
        Always targets pop&infra last
            If it is destroyed, the market decivs
    Effects
        Alter Supply: Increases/Decreases core industry output of a random commodity by x amount
        Alter hazard: Increases hazard by x
        Alter accessability: Decreases accessability by x
        Alter stability: Decreases stability by x
        Alter defense: Decreases ground defense by x
        Spawn hostile fleets: Periodically spawns a friendly/hostile derelict fleet (no guardians) that patrols the system, up to x fp

    This encourages you to treat this as a sort of bonsai tree, constantly minmaxing the effects, minimizing negatives, maximizing positives
    Extremely rare - only 1-2 if any will spawn in a given game

Anti-Asteroid Satellites:

Bugfixes
    Fixed a rare bug taht caused a crash in campaign due to ai

Num of satellites per planet reduced to 2
    FAR less oppressive, now, yet still very helpful

Ships
    Overclocked targetting (Frontal plate system) now 1. Overloads for far longer 2. Lasts for far less
    Infinite range removed from core and connector, replaced with a long-lasting infintie range system that doesnt overload
        Works on a cycle of, say, 23 secs of infinite range and 7 secs of normal
        Gives you a bit of breathing room
    Harpoon MRM small removed from most variants, as it was way too spammy
    All weapons either now have secondary or primary PD capabilties
        PD_ALSO and PD tags respectively
    Variants
        Standard
            Rebalanced the frontal plates to be far more ballistics-focused
            To compensate for the lost OP, the left plate now has harpoon doubles
        Ordnance
            Replaced annihilator pods with jackhammer/typhoon respectively
            Variant weight drastically reduced
        Beamer
            Replaced most missiles with DEMs
            Variant weight moderately reduced
        Shielded
            Connector module Locust replaced with hellbore to reduce spam
            Variant weight slightly reduced
        New:
        Blaster
            Overfluxed, overgunned
            Energy focus
            Plasma cannons, heavy blasters, and antimatter blasters
            Fucking terrifying -- But with a very small variant spawn chance
        Mining
            About 20 mining blasters in total, is capable of stripping armor off anything
            General mining theme
            Pretty rare
    Core
        Do not fire through added - modules will no longer fire through the core, enhancing flank capabilities
        Weapons adjusted in general
    Core/Connector
        Max recoil of weapons reduced to 10%
            Sounds like a buff, but is actually a fat nerf as it makes it way easier to dodge projectiles

2.1.1a:
SAVE COMPATABLE
SOme misc balance changes, such as reducing the time the superheavy damper is active for, increasing targetting overclock cooldown, switching the ordnance locust to a hurricane

2.1.1:
SAVE COMPATABLE

Satellites significantly buffed: Heavy combat modules now have the system "Overclocked Targetting", which multiples weapon range by a factor of 100 for ~10 seconds, before overloading the module for 10 seconds. Has custom AI so that it doesn't activate when it's fighting a nearby ship. The satellites were a little sucky at their role as a long-ranged artillery platform, and this will significantly alleviate that flaw.
Core given "Superheavy damper field", a damepr field that reduces damage taken by 90% but only lasts for 2.5 seconds, has a 1 second cooldown, has 2 charges, and takes a while to recharge. The intent is to give cores a small amount of survivability against strike attacks, so you cant just rush in and burst it down. You're forced to at least hit it for 2.5 seconds, and at worst, 6 full seconds.
Heavy combat modules have been given armored weapon mounts.
Their beams are now modded weapons, that have instant travel time. This makes the beamer varient scary.
Raised DP/FP to 60.
Swarm variant is more common and now is composed almost entirely out of wasps. https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/Smileys/default/smiley.gif

Misc. cleanup

2.1.0a
Removes magiclib dependency

2.1.0
MAYBE SAVE COMPATABLE I DONT REMEMBER
Makes satellites work a bit more consistantly
Raesvelg now starts with satellites (You can generate satellites on planets via the config)
Hopefully fixed an edge case crash

2.0.0
NOT SAVE COMPATBLE
Massively refactors most of the mod
Fixed a few critical bugs
Fixed a few misc bugs
Changed some satellite stats
Game should be significantly more stable

1.0.5a
LIKELY SAVE COMPATABLE

Fixes up a few things from the last updates and polishes it

1.0.5

HOPEFULLY SAVE COMPATBLE

Laid very initial groundwork for next condition
Made a workaround for a bug that caused a crash when a game was loaded

1.0.4
INCOMPATABLE WITH PREVIOUS SAVES

Added a few config options for discovering every satellite at once
Added a stopgap for the satellite fleet drift issue by forcing the satellite fleet on fleets interacting with the planet to orbit the planet
Improved station digging code so that it almost always finds the satellite entity and returns important data, even if the entity we interact with isnt a station
Added a lot more debug code that should hopefully catch and resolve scenarios where entity is null apon application of the satellite condition
Improved code for fighting your own faction's satellites to use a better method
Increased satellite sensor profile to 3 from 1

Backend:
Documented campaignplugin heavily
Misc documentation and annotations
Misc nullchecks
Misc naming improvements
Deleted unneccessary files, renamed a few to be more descriptive and accurate

1.0.3
Added a few config options for enabling/disabling a few features
Reworked some of the backend
Satellites now always defend markets and stations if you interact with them
Upgraded debugging
More station compatibility

1.0.2
Fixed NPE on fighting station markets

1.0.1
Fixed NPE on simulation
Removed weapons from the game, they were unused
Added tips
Satellites can no longer turn
Most likely save compatable? Probably?

1.0.0

Release
Satellites no longer spawn in core worlds.
Fixed up some combat AI.
Polished some things
Fixed the console command

1.1.0_beta:

Added a new console command, FindPlanetsWithConditionId (conditionId). Lists all planets in the game with a given condition. Syntax: FindPlanetsWithConditionId (conditionId)

1.0.0_beta:

Finishing up the beta stage. All major bugs seem to have vanished and functionality has never been better.
Added a new very rare swarm variant. This one will kick your ass.

0.0.6_beta:
Adds a bunch of questionably balanced variants. Fixes a few bugs. Reduces satellite DP to one to hopefully let their allies deploy more ships.

0.0.5_beta:
Reworked a lot of the backend. Improved a lot of ***, although in a way that makes me unhappy.

Next update will probably be a huge quality pass.

0.0.4_beta:
Fixed a few crashes.

Improved polish further.
Buffed satellites FP.
Buffed satellite range.
Nearly perfects fleet interception.

More misc changes. All in all, its way more playable now.

0.0.3_beta:
Fixed a few crashes.
Improved the functionality of hostile fleet interception. It now works. Somewhat.

You can now fight your own colony's satellites.
Improved the description of the condition.
Added illustrations that arent placeholders.

Misc polish and ***.

0.0.2_beta:
Fixed a NPE when loading saves. Hopefully.

Please tell me if you get any strange crashes at random, I found a possible hole in the logic of my design (I am assuming many variables will not be null, they may be).

0.0.1_beta:
Satellite balance: Nerfed the range of the satellites, reduced the number of the satellites, reduced the amount of harpoons on the heavy combat modules, reduced the health/armor of the heavy combat modules. Satellites now start at 70% CR.

New features: Untested framework for fleets being attacked by satellites if the fleets want to attack the planet.

New description for satellites. New sprite for satellites in orbit of entities.
Cleaned up some backend code.

Many more misc changes I won't be assed to document until release.

0.0.0_beta:
Beta release
