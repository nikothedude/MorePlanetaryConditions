STEP 1: How do we want the player to interact with the supernova?

IDea one: It triggers on its own and sends shockwaves through the entire sector
    Your're told by your sensors officer after it subsides that something happened at x coordinates
    Get a breadcrumb...


STEP 2: What is the challenge of the supernova? (Most important bit)

    Natural threats:
        Radiation
        Heat
        The supernova remnant itself

    Unnatural threats:
        Dweller
            A hole in fucking space
        Scavengers
            EVERYONE noticed this
        Tri-tach
        Diktat (Low amounts)
        Hegemony (Low amounts, countering tritach?)
