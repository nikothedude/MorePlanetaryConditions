Idea; Hook into false idols? Have to deal with someone related to the conspiracy?

Idea one
    The church will never pull out, so...
    You have to convince them youre innocent

    Give some guy a tour of your planet with the core
        Lose stability? Unrest?
        Have to do a lot of prep work beforehand

    And even after that, you have to do some extra legwork

Idea two
    The church is a highly divided nation

    People do not like the fact the knights of ludd exist
        Ludd himself was anti-militaristic
        So... you're approached, or you find, someone who doesnt like the knights

        Offers to guide you through the process of dismantling part of the knights
            You can't fully eradicate them, but you can REALLY punch them
            Doing this will cause the church, or the knights, to pull out
