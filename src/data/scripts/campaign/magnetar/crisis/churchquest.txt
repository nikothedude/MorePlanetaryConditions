Idea; Hook into false idols? Have to deal with someone related to the conspiracy?

Idea one
    The church will never pull out, so...
    You have to convince them youre innocent

    Give some guy a tour of your planet with the core
        Lose stability? Unrest?
        Have to do a lot of prep work beforehand

    And even after that, you have to do some extra legwork

Idea two
    The church is a highly divided nation

    People do not like the fact the knights of ludd exist
        Ludd himself was anti-militaristic
        So... you're approached, or you find, someone who doesnt like the knights

        Offers to guide you through the process of dismantling part of the knights
            You can't fully eradicate them, but you can REALLY punch them
            Doing this will cause the church, or the knights, to pull out

    Ideas?
        The knights are hypocritical - use tech for war
            Can you trick them into accepting high tech things?
                Will start to field higher tech ships in their fleets... people will get upset
                Could record a handoff of omega weaponry to them... combat drone replicator?

        And then what?
            Need to capitalize on this - make this information public
            Fly to various comm relays and inject this into the datafeed
                Knights fleets patrol them

        Still not enough
            The knights are still holding ground
            You need to punch them square in the chest, show that they're weak too
            This will provoke the now angry populace

        Finally, parlay with a planetary governor
            If they purge the knights, the entire church will feel pressured to do so

        OR/AND - supply worlds with armaments
            BEGIN THE REVOLUTION!
            Your insurgent buddies will help you here

        SOME interaction with knight errant

    COMPLICATIONS
        At least one comms relay is trapped and will blow your fucking fleet up

        Significant church rep loss
        Possible insurgencies on your luddic majority worlds?

    END
        All church worlds receive a massive fleet size mult penalty and the church pulls out of the war
        Lasts for 4 cycles or so


    After forcing x factions out, church fleet approaches
        INTRODUCE CHARACTER ALOOF MILITANT

            Points you to

    CHARACTER ONE - ALOOF MILITANT
        Finds you after forcing x factions out

        "It's you... we were told you were around here, but we had no proof!"
        "Ludd bless us for finding you"
        "You are fighting a war against the knights. We don't like them either - hammer in hand instead of a book of ludd"
        "Come to these coordinates. Ludd bless"

    Militants
