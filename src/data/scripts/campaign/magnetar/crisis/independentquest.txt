    Indies are not strong alone
    They are a significant portion of the IAIIC, but only because theres a bunch
    But that would be way too much work to make a full questline for each

    Solution: Make a bunch of one-and-done quests for the mercs

Tactistar
    In Culann or something

    Paid for by the IAIIC

    "How much to buy out their contract?"
    "How much to purchase your protection?"

    Can buy them out, or buy protection

The Hammer
    Luddic

    Some luddic indie world

    Will outright refuse to divest
    Chose to work with the IAIIC

    Have to glass a small city to eradicate them

    Big rep hit with indies and a smaller hit with the church

Blackknife
    Some pirate world

    Pirates, lol

    Paid for by the IAIIC
    Mostly does sabotage

    Cares about honor (ironically), contract integrity, *But*
    Wronged by X Pirate

    "Go fuck them up. If you do this, my name in the underworld won't be tarnished"
    Go raid some pirate world, or base, or kill a pirate
        Kanta's Den?
    IMMEDIATELY cancels their contract on completion

Want at least four more
