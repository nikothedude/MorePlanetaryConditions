TRITACHYON

Go to high contact and ask about it
    They get a bit freaked out at first and activate a privacy field
        "This comes from very high up"
    Need to do a favor first before they'll even allow you to try and strike a deal
        Risky for them, so they want personal assurance

        Ideas?
            Get a package from deep space, it's valuable or something
                Have to go around a few bars, comm relays, etc. to find data
                    Once 3 breadcrumbs, location found
                Someone was following in your footsteps and will be there when you get there
            Scrub some suspicious records from a comms relay
                Likely too short and not very strenuous

            Combine the two? The package is actually a black-cache of blackmail material
                Not only do you wipe it of the material of the contact, but you give it to them, giving them TONS of power and upgrading their contact level

                This might be the best idea - as the blackmail could be used against the execs to not obliterate
                the contact for asking about the IAIIC

    Once this is done, they go to ask the execs about it
        Wait a few days
    Then they return, and terms of the withdrawl are "laid bare"
        Not really, its more of heavily implied

        AI cores? Omega weapons? Lots of credits? Not totally sure

        Alternatively, you can spend a buncha SP to keep the blackmail for yourself and threaten to use it on TriTach
            Big rep hit but they pull out
