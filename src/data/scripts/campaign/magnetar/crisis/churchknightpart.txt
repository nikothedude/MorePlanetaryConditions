Multi-step, multi-part, non-linear

General structure here?

Step 1: Create caches of weapons and supplies on various church worlds
Step 2: Distribute fliers advertising ways to fight against the government - mostly nonviolently
    Probably causes a rep loss? Something?
Step 3: Move in to covertly take out key knight commanders, to disrupt their response and information control
    Bribery, or murder?
    Maybe this is the only part that really matters. Caches of course should be made but this is the key
    This also weakens the knights - maybe we should just reflavor this?
    "The knights are too strong at the moment, but an overt attack is too obvious. We need to make people disappear"
    OR
    "We must exploit cracks in the foundation - direct attacks will never work. We must exploit the greed of these few people"
Step 4: Establish militant cells/reactivate militant cells on church worlds
    Or maybe just use them to help you with the other tasks?
    Not all these militants are OUR militant. Some are tangently related, like pathers.

"The Luddic people need to become aware of their own political and military power - and also to be given it."

    Why is it not enough to just get the talking heads on our side?
        "The Luddic peoples, especially on church worlds, are demilitarized and docile."
